        <h2><em>American</em> places I've travelled:</h2>
        <p>
          One of the first major places I've travelled to is Honolulu, Hawaii!

        <p>
          I was very fortunate - <strong>lucky</strong> to have the opportunity to travel to Hawaii. I was 11 years old, and Gitwinksihlkw Four Crest Dancers were set to travel to Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>
           Last minute, a few people dropped out. A meeting was called to decide who would fill the spots paid for. Names of cultural dancers were put into a hat,
        </p>
        <p>
           and my name was chosen. I flew to Hawaii on my 12th Birthday!

        </p>
        <p>
          Also with the Gitwinksihlkw Four Crest Dancers, I've travelled to Canada's capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our dance group performed at the Canadian National Museum, and also toured to the neighbouring province.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ottawa, Ontario</li>
          <li>Hull, Quebec</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After graduating from highschool, I became a volunteer with <a href="https://katimavik.org/en/">Katimavik.</a>

        <p>
          I was able to travel to a few different provinces to volunteer:

        <ul>
          <li>Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan</li>
          <li>Winnipeg, Manitoba</li>
          <li>Truro, Nova Scotia</li>
          <li>Moncton, New Brunswhick</li>
        </ul>
